# Coding House Tips & Tricks

README with tips and tricks to improve and find more efficients ways of working with our environments.

I recommend using aliases to access your main folder faster and moving around CLI faster.

You can access aliases using:

```
vi ~/.files/.aliases
```

You can then add your alias using the following format:

```
alias NAME_OF_ALIAS="COMMAND_TO_RUN"
```
i.e.
```
alias cdhome="cd Documents/Main/"
```

To open Brackets using Command Line you can add the following alias:
```
alias brack="open -a 'Brackets'"
```
Then in Command line you can use brack to open any file
```
brack app.js
```
